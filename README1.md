## My process
This challenge was a bit hectic because i didn't know to properly center my divs and its contents and also to link my fonts but it taught me more about the display and the flex property.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```html
<section class="main">
  <div class="info">
    <span>content</span>
    <p>content</p>
  </div>
</section>

```css
.main {
    height: 200px;
    position: relative;
}

.info {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 0;
    right: 0;
}

```

### Continued development

I will still continue practicing CSS until i am comfortable then i will jump to JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- [study tonight](https://www.studytonight.com/css-howtos/how-to-align-content-of-a-div-to-the-bottom-using-css) - This helped me with aligning a div using the bottom CSS property. 
- [CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/apply-a-filter-to-a-background-image/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the filter property. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning CSS.
